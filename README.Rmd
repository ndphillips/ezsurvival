The goal of ezsurvival is to make it easy to fit and visualize survival models. Essentially, it provides wrapper functions around commonly used functions from survival packages such as `survival::survfit()` and `survminer::ggsurvplot()`, while providing user-friendly in-line messages, notes, and warnings.

## Installation

`ezsurvival` is hosted at https://git.the.flatiron.com/qs_r_packages/ezsurvival. Here is how to install it:

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_gitlab(repo = "qs_r_packages/ezsurvival", 
                         host = "git.the.flatiron.com",
                         build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

## Example

```{r example}
library(ezsurvival)
library(dplyr)
```

It's best to start with one-row-per-patient (ORPP) cohort object that contains columns corresponding to PatientID, IndexDate (like `LOT1StartDate`), CensorDate, and an EventDate (like `DateOfDeath`)

For this example, we'll `ez_cohort`, a dataframe of simulated patients contained in `ezsurvival`:

```{r}
ez_cohort
```

Use the derive_ functions to calculate key derived columns:

* `follow_up_date` - DateOfDeath, if known, and censordate, otherwise
* `follow_up_days` - Days from LOT1StartDate to follow_up_date
* `Death` - A logical column indicating whether or not the event (death) is known

```{r}
cohort <- ez_cohort %>%
  
  derive_follow_up_date(event_date = "DateOfDeath",
                      censor_date = "CensorDate") %>%
  
  derive_follow_up_time(index_date = "LOT1StartDate") %>%
  
  derive_event_status(event_date = "DateOfDeath")
```

Here is our updated cohort object:

```{r}
cohort %>%
  select(PatientID, follow_up_date, follow_up_days, event_status, everything())
```

Use `plot_follow_up_time` to visualize the time at risk data

```{r, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 4, out.width = "85%"}
plot_follow_up_time(cohort, 
                    follow_up_time = "follow_up_days", 
                    event_name = "Death", 
                    index_name = "LOT1 Start")
```

Use `fit_survival()` to fit the survival model - we'll set the follow up time to be follow_up_days, event status to be Death, and include group as a categorical covariate.

<!-- If we were using `survival::survfit()` we'd need to specify this nasty looking formula `survival::survfit(survival::Surv(follow_up_days, event_status, type = 'right') ~ group, data = cohort)` directly.  -->

<!-- With `fit_survival()`, we can simply specify the column names of interest and let the function take care of the formula: -->

```{r}
cohort_fit <- fit_survival(cohort, 
                           follow_up_time = "follow_up_days", 
                           terms = "group")
```

The result is a `survfit` object (from the `survival` package)

```{r}
class(cohort_fit)

cohort_fit
```

Use `plot_survival()` to plot the result. Use the `index_name` and `event_name` to give descriptive names to the key events:

```{r, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 5, out.width = "85%"}
plot_survival(cohort_fit, 
              cohort = cohort, 
              index_name = "LOT1 Start", 
              event_name = "Death")
```
