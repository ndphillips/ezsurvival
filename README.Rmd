The goal of `iwillsurvive` is to make it easy to fit and visualize simple 
survival models. It does this by providing an intuitive functional interface and
user-friendly in-line messages, notes, and warnings, while leveraging the 
gold-standard `survival` package for all statistical methods.

## Installation

`iwillsurvive` is hosted at https://github.com/ndphillips/iwillsurvive. Here is 
how to install it:

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github(repo = "https://github.com/ndphillips/iwillsurvive",
                         build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

## Example

```{r example}
library(iwillsurvive)
library(dplyr)
```

It's best to start with one-row-per-patient (ORPP) cohort object that contains 
columns corresponding to 

- `patientid`, a unique patient identifier
- `index_date`, a date corresponding to an index date.
- `censor_date`, date corresponding to when patients were censored
- `event_date`, date corresponding to the event of interest. NA values indicate 
that the event was not observed.

`iwillsurvive` provides one such example in `ez_cohort`, a dataframe of `r scales::comma(nrow(ez_cohort))`
simulated patients:

```{r}
ez_cohort
```

Use the `derive_*()` functions to calculate key derived columns:

* `followup_date` - `dateofdeath`, if known, and `censordate`, otherwise
* `followup_days` - Days from `index_date` (in our case, `lotstartdate`) to 
`followup_date`
* `event_status` - A logical column indicating whether or not the event 
(`dateofdeath`) is known.

```{r}
cohort <- ez_cohort %>%
  
  derive_followup_date(event_date = "dateofdeath",
                       censor_date = "lastvisitdate") %>%
  
  derive_followup_time(index_date = "lotstartdate") %>%
  
  derive_event_status(event_date = "dateofdeath")
```

Use `iwillsurvive()` to fit the survival model. We'll set the follow up time to
be `followup_days` and specify "condition" as a term (i.e.; covariate) to be 
used in the model.

<!-- If we were using `survival::survfit()` we'd need to specify this nasty 
looking formula `survival::survfit(survival::Surv(followup_days, event_status, 
type = 'right') ~ group, data = cohort)` directly.  -->

<!-- With `iwillsurvive()`, we can simply specify the column names of interest 
and let the function take care of the formula: -->

```{r}
cohort_iws <- iwillsurvive(cohort, 
                           followup_time = "followup_days",
                           terms = "condition",
                           event_title = "Death", 
                           index_title = "LOT1 Start")
```

Print the object to see summary information:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
cohort_iws
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="60%"}
knitr::include_graphics("inst/figures/print_iwillsurvive.png")
```

Is that an ascii survival curve? I think so!

Use `plot_survival()` to plot the Kaplan-Meier survival curve:

```{r, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 5.5, out.width = "100%"}
plot_survival(cohort_iws)
```
